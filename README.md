# Titanic 78.5% correct
# The models in Titanic_TJ.R and Titanic_caret.R use data from a train table to predict the survival of the passengers in a test table. In Titanic_TJ.R, the accuracy of the model was 74% using linear regression. In Titanic_caret.R the library "caret" allowed for more accuracte models by knn and also linear regression. Correctness of the models were scored based on the real data from these passengers in a submission through Kaggle.
# More alterations will be made to improve the accuracy of the model
